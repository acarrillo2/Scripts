* Got dataframes to filter for correct dates
* Got matplotlib to save graphs of dataframes as png files

## TODO
* Index against SP500
  * Maybe keep the graph we have, and just have two graphs in the template per page
    * One with indexed values 
    * One with RAW values on a chart
* Build HTML template
* Insert png / df data into html
